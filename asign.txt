**Task**
Intelligent Urban Mobility Analytics & GenAI Insights Platform

---

**Project Goal**
Build an end-to-end analytics and GenAI system on real-world urban transportation data. The platform performs scalable data cleaning, KPI computation, SQL analytics, PySpark ETL, GenAI-powered insights, and cloud-based API deployment.

---

**Problem Statement**
City planners and transportation companies require scalable insights into trip demand, congestion, revenue patterns, and rider behavior. This project transforms raw trip data into actionable KPIs and conversational intelligence.

---

**Tech Stack**

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* SQL
* PySpark
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* OpenAI or Gemini API
* LangChain
* AWS / Azure (Serverless)

---

**Dataset (Open Source, Large Scale)**

**Primary Dataset (Recommended)**
NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data (Kaggle)

## End-to-End Task Breakdown

---

### 1. Data Ingestion & Cleaning (Python + OOP)

**Objective**
Prepare raw trip data for analytics.

**Tasks**

* Load raw taxi trip CSV files
* Handle data quality issues:

  * Missing passenger counts
  * Zero or negative trip distances
  * Invalid timestamps
* Convert data types:

  * Pickup and dropoff timestamps → datetime
  * Fare, tip, and total amount → numeric

**Feature Engineering**

* Hour of day
* Day of week
* Month
* Quarter

**OOP Design**

* `MobilityDataAnalyzer` class:

  * `load_data()`
  * `clean_data()`
  * `feature_engineering()`
  * `export_clean_data()`

---

### 2. KPI Computation & Exploratory Analysis

**Core KPIs**

* Total and monthly trip revenue
* Average trip distance
* Average fare per trip
* Tip percentage
* Trips per hour (demand pattern)
* Revenue per mile
* Peak vs off-peak utilization

**Visualizations**

* Monthly revenue trends
* Hourly demand heatmap
* Fare and distance outliers
* Tip distribution by time of day

---

### 3. Analytical SQL Layer (No Schema Design)

**Objective**
Enable business-focused SQL analytics.

**Tasks**
    
* Load cleaned data into SQLite or PostgreSQL
* Write analytical SQL queries:

  * Peak demand hours using `GROUP BY`
  * Revenue by pickup zone
  * Top 10 highest-revenue days
  * Average fare by weekday
  * Monthly growth using window functions
* Export query results for reporting

---

### 4. Scalable ETL with PySpark

**Objective**
Efficiently process large-scale trip data.

**Tasks**

* Read multiple months of taxi data using Spark
* Clean and transform data at scale
* Compute KPIs:

  * Monthly revenue
  * Demand by zone
  * Peak-hour congestion indicators
  * High-value trip segments
* Write processed outputs to Parquet format
* Capture Spark DAG and explain performance benefits

---

### 5. GenAI Urban Mobility Insights Assistant

**Objective**
Enable natural-language analytics for decision-makers.

**Capabilities**

* Answer questions such as:

  * “What were the busiest pickup zones last month?”
  * “When is surge demand highest?”
  * “Why did revenue drop in February?”

**Generated Outputs**

* Monthly executive summaries
* Trend explanations

**Technology**

* OpenAI or Gemini API
* LangChain for prompt orchestration
* Prompt templates for consistent KPI reasoning

**Scalability Strategy (100GB+)**

* Storage: S3 or ADLS (Parquet)
* Processing: Spark or Databricks
* Indexing: Vector databases (FAISS or Pinecone)
* Retrieval: RAG over aggregated mobility metrics

---

### 6. Cloud Deployment: Serverless Mobility Analytics API (Optional)

**Objective**
Expose analytics via cloud-based APIs.

**Tasks**

* Store aggregated KPIs in S3 or Azure Blob Storage
* Deploy using:

  * AWS Lambda or Azure Functions
* API Endpoints:

  * `/monthly-revenue`
  * `/peak-hours`
  * `/top-zones`
* Enable scheduled execution (daily or monthly)
* Implement logging and monitoring

---

## Final Deliverables

* Public GitHub repository containing:

  * Source code
  * Cleaned taxi trip dataset
  * Python OOP analytics notebook or script
  * KPI visualizations
  * SQL query file and results
  * PySpark ETL pipeline
  * GenAI assistant (script or UI)
  * Architecture and scalability diagram
  * Execution screenshots
  * Deployed cloud API (optional)
